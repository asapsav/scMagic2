# scMagic2
Vector DB of software tools for scRNA-seq analysis

# How to use
1. Use `make_vectordb.py` to create and query a vector database of scRNA-esq tools
2. Run `steamlit run test_vectordb.py` to use vector db as coding recomendatin engine for your scRNA-seq analysis Jupyter Notebook

# Roadmap
- [x] Create vector database of scRNA-seq tools
- [x] Create a simple query engine for vector database
- [x] Create a simple web app to use vector database as coding recomendation engine
- [ ] Make web app use vector DB directly
- [ ] Make live connection with [source data](https://github.com/scRNA-tools/scRNA-tools/tree/master/database)
- [ ] Optimise vector DB for scEvals
